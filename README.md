# -Quiescent-Current-LDO-with-Embedded-BGR-using-Adaptive-Pole-Tracking-
Designed a 96 nA quiescent current LDO with ultra-low-power BGR using Adaptive Pole Tracking and Transconductance control. Achieved &lt;12 mV overshoot, 30 μs settling, and 15 mV/V line regulation at 50 mA. Simulated and laid out in 0.18 μm BCD using Cadence Virtuoso and Spectre.
